README

To use this, create a new Django app called pgopen (this can be changed, but some links will have to be changed).

urls.py should be included in your pgopen app foled, and your main urls file should link to it
by adding this line : "url(r'', include('pgopen.urls')),"

views.py should be included in your pgopen folder. 

The shared folder contains all css, js, and images. It should be in your project root and set as your static file in 
your project settings.

The templates folder should be in your pgopen app. It contains the base template and all pages.
